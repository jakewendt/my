These are my common settings.  Putting them out is forcing me to clean them up as they are pieces jammed together.

I should make some sort of non-destructive installation script, 
but for now ...

ln -s  ~/github_repo/jakewendt/my

ln -s ~/my/vim          .vim
ln -s ~/my/vimrc        .vimrc
ln -s ~/my/bashrc       .bashrc
ln -s ~/my/bash_profile .bash_profile
