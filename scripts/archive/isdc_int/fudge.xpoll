#  This is a failed attempt to set up a way to nice the xpoll 
#  processes only on the Office net.  But this doesn't work.
#  The only thing I found that did work was putting the nice 
#  command in the TASK line in the resource files, but that 
#  can't be easily done and undone for different cases.
