== my

These are my common settings.  Putting them out is forcing me to clean them up as they are pieces jammed together.

I should make some sort of non-destructive installation script, 
but for now ...

cd ~
ln -s ~/github_repo/jakewendt/my

ln -s ~/my/init/vim          .vim
ln -s ~/my/init/vimrc        .vimrc
ln -s ~/my/init/bashrc       .bashrc
ln -s ~/my/init/bash_profile .bash_profile
ln -s ~/my/init/autotest     .autotest



== Todo

* Finish importing all other scripts and such
* clean them up a bit
* Rename scripts/ bin/ ???
